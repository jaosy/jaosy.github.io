            "Blocks-based programming environments are a popular tool to teach children how to code, but they are often inaccessible for children with visual impairments who cannot interact with their visual components. I was part of a research lab that worked on Blocks4All, a touchscreen-based blocks-based programming environment that is accessible with screen readers and tries to bridge this gap in accessible computer science education.",

            "We added more complex functionality such variable and functions, and improved the user interface to be more accessible with Apple's VoiceOver, Dynamic Type (scalable text) and better palettes for users with color blindness."
